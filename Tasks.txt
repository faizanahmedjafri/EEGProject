when audio is playing screen has two button high pitch and low picth and person will click button according to the sound being played

click on recording give option to play audio 1 or 2
user selcted audio 1 then ask whether to play for 3 or 5 minutes
now I selected 3 minutes then test start audio is playing eeg data is coming then user will click on button of high pitch or low pitch save when user clicks button
when test done save the data in file

when recording stops then device still gives data  user should be redirected to initial screen and data recording should be stopped
